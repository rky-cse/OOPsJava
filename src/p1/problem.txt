Assignment 1: Create a "Book" Class
Task Overview:
Create a Java class named Book that encapsulates the following properties:

title (String)

author (String)

price (double)

Requirements:
Constructor(s):

Provide a constructor that initializes all the attributes.

Optionally, add a default (no-argument) constructor if you like.

Getter and Setter Methods:

Create getters and setters for each of the attributes.

toString() Method:

Override the toString() method to return a string representation of the Book object (include all attributes).

Testing Your Class:

Create a separate Main class with a main() method.

In the main() method, create at least one instance of Book and print it out using System.out.println().

Guidelines:
Keep your code clean and well-documented with comments.

Focus on correctly encapsulating the attributes and providing a neat string representation.

Don't worry about additional functionalities for now; the aim is to solidify your understanding of the basics of OOP in Java.
