Assignment 2: Create a "Library" and "EBook" Classes
Task Overview:
We'll build on your knowledge of OOP by introducing inheritance and polymorphism.

Requirements:
Create a Parent Class (Book):

Use the Book class you created in the previous assignment as the base class.

Create a Child Class (EBook):

Inherit from Book.

Add an additional attribute: fileSize (in MB, as a double).

Provide a constructor for EBook that initializes all attributes (including those from Book).

Override the toString() method to include the fileSize information.

Demonstrate Polymorphism:

In your Main class, create an array or list of type Book that holds both Book and EBook objects.

Iterate over this collection and print out each object. Notice how the toString() method behaves differently for EBook.

Guidelines:

Focus on code clarity and proper use of inheritance.

Make sure your EBook class correctly calls the superclass constructor to initialize inherited properties.

Add comments where necessary to explain your implementation.
